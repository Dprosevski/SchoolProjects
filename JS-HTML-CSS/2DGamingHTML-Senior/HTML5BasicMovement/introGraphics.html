<h1>Graphics Demo</h1>

<p>
I learned how canvas works, how to draw different shapes and importing images. I implemented canvas as scene, and bird and manual drawings as sprites, using "simpleGame.js" engine as referrence. I learned to how: <br>	
- sprites and scenes work and how to syncronize them together<br>
- to use X and Y as canvas coordinates<br>
- manual drawing of sprite vs image search<br>
- how to make cursor a sprite (crosshair) and make it follow the cursor<br>
The most important thing is that I have a good understanding of how scenes and sprites work and my goal is for the next assignment to use these skills of sprites flying different directions and angle, while using crosshair to aim for the birds (implement collision).
